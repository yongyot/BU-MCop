/**
 * An Adapter of Content :D<br>
 * <br>
 * If you don't know about "Adapter", let me explain it in a short example:<br>
 * <ol>
 * <li>You are a girl and you have to sit during the time taking a piss.</li>
 * <li>I am a boy and I can stand straight while taking a piss.</li>
 * </ol>
 * => If you have water-spout in your hands, you can stand upright to have a
 * piss =))<br>
 * And from that point, you would have known: Yes, water-spout is an Adapter
 * =)).<br>
 * <br>
 * Just joking, forget it! Google Apdater design patterns =)) <br>
 * <br>
